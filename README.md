## Molecular Display of the Animal Meta-Venome for Discovery of Novel Therapeutic Peptides

### System Requirements

This repository contains all scripts to analyze screening data for the animal meta-venome peptide library, described in the manuscript Molecular Display of the Animal Meta-Venome for Discovery of Novel Therapeutic Peptides. All scripts are coded in R 4.2.0 under Windows 10 x64. The required packages to run the scripts are as followed: tidyverse, openxlsx, readxl, scales, magrittr, grid, ComplexHeatmap, igraph, foreach, doParallel, mgsub, data.table, qgraph, stringr, ggsignif, plotly, htmlwidgets, viridisLite, reshape2.

### Instruction for Use

All codes can be run as it in local R/RStudio after installing the required packages and loading the my_workspace.RData file, which contains the processed library screening data. No other software installations are needed.

### Demo

Each custom script is designed to reproduce the corresponding main and extended figures in the manuscript. It should take under 5 minutes to run each script. The source data files for producing the main and extended figures are source_dataset_main.xlsx and source_dataset_main.xlsx.
